  # Introduction to Hooks


  Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class
  and handling changes.


  ## The useState Hook


  This is the most common hook used for managing local component state.


  ```

  const [data, setData] = useState(null);   

  ```

  ## The useEffect Hook


  The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.


  ```

  useEffect(() => {   //Runs on the first render   //And any time any dependency
  value changes }, [prop, state]); 

  ```
